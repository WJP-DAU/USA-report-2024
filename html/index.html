                                            This report presents data derived from the General Population Poll in two thematic sections, each highlighting a distinct dimension of the rule of law from the perspective of people in the United States. The sections cover public perceptions and attitudes towards accountability, authoritarianism, trust in institutions, and the rule of law. In <i>U.S. Rule of Law Trends and the </i><i>2024 Election,</i> we also introduce new insights related to the 2024 presidential election. The survey now captures detailed perceptions of electoral authorities, voting rights, the integrity of the electoral process, acceptance of electoral results, trust in electoral actors, and public views on the judiciary's independence, particularly in scenarios where courts might need to intervene in electoral outcomes.

                                            A majority of Americans view the current state of the rule of law in the United States negatively, despite their positive associations with the concept of rule of law itself. This dichotomy reflects growing concerns over the actual implementation and integrity of the rule of law in the country. While both Democrats and Republicans overwhelmingly agree on the critical importance of the rule of law for the future of the United States, its democracy, and their own lives, these shared beliefs mask deeper concerns about the erosion of government accountability and institutional trust.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Since 2013, public perception of government accountability has declined, with a 30 percentage-point drop in respondents who believe high-ranking government officials would be held accountable for breaking the law. Although this perception improved slightly between 2021 and 2024, accountability remains a critical issue, and the public's views are increasingly divided along partisan lines. Compared to 2018, a greater percentage of Democrats believe that high-ranking government officials are held accountable for misconduct, while views among Republicans have grown increasingly pessimistic.<sup>1</sup>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Additionally, the erosion of the rule of law values is evident, with declining percentages of Americans favoring citizen participation over government efficiency and believing that the president should always obey the law and courts. Moreover, there has been a slight increase in those who believe it is unnecessary for people to obey the laws of a government they did not vote for, indicating a potential weakening of civic responsibility and respect for legal frameworks.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The public's confidence in institutions designed to check executive power, such as Congress and the courts, has also diminished since 2013, although there was a slight recovery in this confidence between 2021 and 2024. Interestingly, the only group that has seen a net increase in confidence to stop illegal actions by the president is the citizens themselves. This suggests a shift towards people’s faith in grassroots accountability rather than institutional checks.

                                            Partisan differences complicate these trends. Historically, Republicans have reported greater trust than Democrats in both citizens and institutions to check executive authority, but Republicans’ confidence has eroded since 2018, while Democrats’ confidence has increased. By 2024, Democrats’ trust in all checks on executive authority exceeded Republicans’.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Overall trust in many key institutions has decreased since 2018, with a particularly pronounced decline in confidence in judges and the media. Trust in local government officials has increased slightly, but national officials are more trusted overall. Partisan differences persist, as Democrats generally trust media, executive, and judicial officials more than Republicans, who maintain higher trust in the police than do Democrats. Since 2018, Democrats’ trust has declined most significantly in the media, while Republicans’ trust has declined most significantly in prosecutors and judges. These trends underscore a growing polarization in perceptions of institutional integrity and fairness.

                                        <p>
                                            Generally, public perception of the justice system’s fairness and independence has significantly deteriorated since 2018, though there has been a notable improvement in the perceived independence of prosecutors between 2021 and 2024. These shifts are also influenced by political affiliation, with Democrats showing increased confidence in the fairness and independence of the justice system, while Republicans’ confidence has deteriorated sharply.

                                            The 2024 presidential election is poised to be a deeply polarizing event, with confidence in the electoral process heavily dependent on political affiliation. Democrats generally express more confidence in the fairness and legitimacy of elections compared to Republicans with the notable exception of voting rights, as Republicans are more likely to believe that voting is equally accessible and convenient for all citizens.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The legitimacy of the 2024 presidential election is also in question, with approximately one-third of respondents indicating they would not accept the election’s results if their preferred candidate does not win. This sentiment is particularly strong among Republicans, nearly half of whom say they would not accept the election results if the Democratic candidate wins. This points to a potential crisis of legitimacy that could undermine the stability of the electoral process.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In the event of contested election results, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to trust local and state election workers, courts, and Congress to fairly determine the outcome, while Republicans place greater trust in the Supreme Court. This divergence in trust reflects broader partisan divisions in perceptions of institutional integrity and fairness.

                                            . While the public continues to express a broad commitment to rule of law principles, the erosion of trust in key institutions, growing partisan divides, and the increasingly precarious perception of accountability pose significant threats to the nation's democratic foundation. The United States, long regarded as a global standard-bearer for democracy and the rule of law, now faces internal weaknesses that threaten this status.

                                            As the 2024 presidential election approaches, the stakes are high. The deepening polarization and mistrust, especially concerning the electoral process and the judiciary, highlights the need for renewed efforts to restore faith in the rule of law. Without such efforts, the United States risks further erosion of its democratic institutions and the very principles that have long underpinned its global leadership in the rule of law. The path forward must involve addressing these issues head-on, strengthening citizens’ understanding of U.S. government and electoral processes, fostering a more inclusive, transparent, and accountable legal system, and ensuring that all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, can trust in the fairness and impartiality of the nation's institutions.

This infographic shows how Democrats and Republicans said they would respond to election results based on the winning candidate.  A total of 46% of Republicans and 27% of Democrats said they would not accept election results as legitimate if the other party’s candidate won. Those figures include the 14% of all Republicans and almost 11% of all Democrats who said they would take action to overturn election results if the other party won.

                                    To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in this report is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizens concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country.

The General Population Poll used to collect data in the United States in 2024 features several new questions that highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, police performance, criminal justice, and security. In total, the General Population Poll questionnaire includes 123 perception-based questions, along with sociodemographic information on all respondents. The GPP in the United States was administered to a sample of 1,046 respondents.

YouGov, Nordic administered the surveys during the month of June 2024, conducting Computer-Assisted Web Interviews (CAWI) using a stratified random sampling design on their online panel. The target population group for this survey included residents aged 18 years or older residing across the following macro-regions: Northeast, Midwest, West, and South.

                                    The General Population Poll in the United States represents an achieved total sample size of 1,046 interviews distributed proportionally across four regions. YouGov, Nordic based the sampling frame on 2022 census figures from the United States Census Bureau, acquiring a proportionally stratified sample by region, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and level of urbanization.

In order to address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the World Justice Project split three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned one option to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Civic Participation, Institutional Performance, and Elections. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. A link to the complete survey instrument in English can be found in the Appendix of this report.

                                    Once a respondent is selected for interview, YouGov sends a unique link to the survey, which is only valid for one single submission. The sampling system algorythm directs panel members to the active survey where their particular profile (gender, age, region) is needed the most.
