<b class="c-purple">EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW</b> reduces corruption, combats poverty and disease, and protects people from injustices large and small. Strengthening the rule of law is an important objective for governments, donors, and civil society organizations around the world. To be effective, rule of law development requires clarity about the fundamental features that define the rule of law, as well as an adequate basis for its evaluation and measurement.

<i>The Rule of Law in the United States: Key Findings from the WJP General Population Poll 2024</i>  presents question-level data drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project. The GPP was conducted through online interviews to a nationally representative sample of 1,046 U.S. households between June 10 and June 18, 2024. This poll was designed to capture data on the experiences and perceptions of ordinary people regarding a variety of themes related to the rule of law.
