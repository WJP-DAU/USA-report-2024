<b class="c-purple">EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW</b> reduces corruption, combats poverty and disease, and protects people from injustices large and small. Strengthening the rule of law is an important objective for governments, donors, and civil society organizations around the world. To be effective, rule of law development requires clarity about the fundamental features that de ne the rule of law, as well as an adequate basis for its evaluation and measurement. 

<i>U.S. Rule of Law Trends & The 2024 Election</i> presents question-level data drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). It is among the data sources that inform the annual WJP Rule of Law Index®, the world’s leading source of original, independent rule of law data. Since 2016, the Index has identified a global rule of law recession, including in the United States.

The GPP was conducted through online interviews to a nationally representative sample of 1,046 U.S. households between June 10 and June 18, 2024. This poll was designed to capture data on the experiences and perceptions of ordinary people regarding a variety of themes related to the rule of law and the integrity of the electoral process.
