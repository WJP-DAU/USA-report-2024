## INTERVIEWING AND QUALITY CONTROL

Once a respondent is selected for interview, YouGov send a unique link to the survey, which is only valid for one single submission. The sampling system algorythm directs panel members to the active survey where their particular profile (gender, age, region) is needed the most.

A "_speed limit_" of 7 minutes was set and used to screen unusual completion times. A total of 61 completed surveys were rejected due to speeding. Interviews averaged 21 minutes in length.

## DATA REVIEW AND JUSTIFICATION

As part of the data analysis process, the team consulted several third-party sources in order to contextualize and validate perception-based data captured by the General Population Poll and compare it with the objective rule of law situation in-country. Peer data sources consulted include select indicators measured by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)'s *AmericasBarometer*, Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Transparency International's *Corruption Perceptions Index*, the Bertelsmann Stiftung's *Transformation Index (BTI)*, and Freedom House's *Freedom in the World*. While certain trends captured by the 2024 General Population Poll in the United States are comparable to trends in perceptions data measured by other indices, the perceptions presented in this report may not always coincide with the reality of the United States's rule of law performance as measured by other sources.

## HISTORICAL DATA

Historical data in this report derives from the *WJP Rule of Law IndexÂ®*'s General Population Poll that is typically administered every two to three years using a nationally representative probability sample ranging from 500 to 1,000 respondents. These household surveys were administered in the three largest cities of most countries until 2018, when the World Justice Project transitioned to nationally representative coverage as the preferred methodology for polling. The historical polling data used in this year's report covers data collected in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2021.
