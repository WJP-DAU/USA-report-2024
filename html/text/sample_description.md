## INTERVIEWING AND QUALITY CONTROL

In total, 94 interviewers worked on this project, including 77 female interviewers. Enumerators worked in 33 regional teams; 19 interviewers were assigned to the Lima and Callao regions and 32 groups of two to three enumerators worked throughout the remaining regions. Interviews were conducted in Spanish.

The supervisory team directly oversaw approximately 9% of all interviews in the field. During data processing, 356 interviews (approximately 35% of the sample) were selected for audio review by the central office and 86 interviews (approximately 8% of the sample) were backchecked via telephone. Interviews averaged 38 minutes in length.

## DATA REVIEW AND JUSTIFICATION

As part of the data analysis process, the team consulted several third-party sources in order to contextualize and validate perception-based data captured by the General Population Poll and compare it with the objective rule of law situation in-country. Peer data sources consulted include select indicators measured by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)'s *AmericasBarometer*, Latinobarómetro, Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Transparency International's *Corruption Perceptions Index*, the Bertelsmann Stiftung's *Transformation Index (BTI)*, and Freedom House's *Freedom in the World*. While certain trends captured by the 2022 General Population Poll in Peru are comparable to trends in perceptions data measured by other indices, the experiences and perceptions presented in this report may not always coincide with the reality of Peru's rule of law performance as measured by other sources.

## HISTORICAL DATA

Historical data in this report derives from the *WJP Rule of Law Index®*'s General Population Poll that is typically administered every two to three years using a nationally representative probability sample ranging from 500 to 1,000 respondents. These household surveys were administered in the three largest cities of most countries until 2018, when the World Justice Project transitioned to nationally representative coverage as the preferred methodology for polling. The historical polling data used in this year's reports was collected in the following intervals: Data for Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru was collected in 2016, 2018, and 2022. Data for Ecuador was collected in 2014, 2017, and 2022.
