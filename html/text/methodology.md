## METHODOLOGY

To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in this report is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizens concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country.

The General Population Poll used to collect data in USA in 2024 features several new questions that highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, police performance, criminal justice, and security. In total, the General Population Poll questionnaire includes 115 perception-based questions and 77 experience-based questions, along with sociodemographic information on all respondents. Additionally, the GPP in USA was administered to a sample of 1,029 respondents.

## DATA COLLECTION

The GPP in USA was conducted for the WJP's *The Rule of Law in Peru: Key Findings from the General Population Poll 2022* with sampling, fieldwork, and data processing by Datum Internacional S.A., based in Lima, Peru. Datum Internacional S.A. administered the surveys between July and August 2022, conducting face-to-face interviews using a multi-stage stratified random sampling design. The target population group for this survey included Peruvians aged 18 years or older residing across 17 regions throughout the country.

## SAMPLE SIZE AND SAMPLE FRAME

The General Population Poll in Peru represents an achieved total sample size of 1,029 interviews distributed proportionally across five zones. Datum Internacional S.A. based the sampling frame on 2017 census figures from the National Institute of Statistics and Information (INEI) and 2020 voter statistics from the National Office of Electoral Processes (ONPE), acquiring a proportionally stratified sample by zone, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and level of urbanization.

In order to address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the World Justice Project split three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned one option to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Hypothetical Situations, Civic Participation, and Institutional Performance. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. A link to the complete survey instrument, in English and Spanish, can be found in the Appendix of this report.

## SAMPLING

Regions and provinces were selected to achieve a nationally representative sample of the country. Districts were selected as the primary sampling unit according to quotas for age, gender, geographic distribution, and socioeconomic level. Within urban and rural districts, census areas and populated centers, respectively, were randomly selected as enumeration areas using probability proportionate to size sampling. The number of enumeration areas assigned to each district was determined by the relative population of each district. Within each enumeration area, survey administrators performed a systematic random route to sample households and randomly selected respondents. If the selected respondent declined to be interviewed or otherwise did not meet the characteristics of the target quota, the interviewer moved on to the next household.

Due to a lack of accessibility, the Loreto and San Martín regions of the Peruvian Amazon were excluded from the study. Loreto and San Martín were replaced by the eastern regions of Ucayali and Madre de Dios, located in the Amazon rainforest and Amazon basin, respectively.
