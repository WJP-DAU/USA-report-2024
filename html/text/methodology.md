## METHODOLOGY

To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in this report is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizens concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country.

The General Population Poll used to collect data in the United States in 2024 features several new questions that highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, police performance, criminal justice, and security. In total, the General Population Poll questionnaire includes 123 perception-based questions, along with sociodemographic information on all respondents. Additionally, the GPP in the United States was administered to a sample of 1,046 respondents.

## DATA COLLECTION

The GPP in the United States was conducted for the WJP's *The Rule of Law in the United States: Key Findings from the General Population Poll 2024* with sampling, fieldwork, and data processing by YouGov, Nordic, based in Copenhagen, Denmark. YouGov, Nordic administered the surveys during the month of June 2024, conducting Computer-Assisted Web Interviews (CAWI) using a stratified random sampling design on their online panel. The target population group for this survey included residents aged 18 years or older residing across the following macro-regions: Northeast, Midwest, West, and South.

## SAMPLE SIZE AND SAMPLE FRAME

The General Population Poll in the United States represents an achieved total sample size of 1,046 interviews distributed proportionally across four regions. YouGov, Nordic based the sampling frame on 2022 census figures from the United States Census Bureau, acquiring a proportionally stratified sample by region, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and level of urbanization.

In order to address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the World Justice Project split three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned one option to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Civic Participation, Institutional Performance, and Elections. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. A link to the complete survey instrument in English, can be found in the Appendix of this report.

## SAMPLING

Regions were selected as the primary sampling unit to achieve a nationally representative sample of the country. Registered online panelist were randomly selected according to quotas for age, gender, geographic distribution, socioeconomic level, and level of urbanization. The sampling plan was approved by WJP before the start of fieldwork.
